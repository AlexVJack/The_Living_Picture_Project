## General info
This project rises from simple process - communication.
Mostly we communicate with our inner circle.
From time to time we communicate with circle that is a bit far from us.
And rarely we communicate with circle that is far away from us.
We can easily visualize this process with our project. And in this perspective we can see global motions that are invisible from inside.

## Technologies
Project is supposed to create with:
* Python 3.7
* Django 2.2
